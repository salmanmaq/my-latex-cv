\section{\faFileText}{SUMMARY}
My strong suits are Python development and machine (deep) learning in both industry and academia. Over the next few years, I intend to develop as a generalist software engineer. For that, I have learned a bit more of modern C++, frontend technologies, data engineering, DevOps, software architecture, and even product management as well.
